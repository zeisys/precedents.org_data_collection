# 1 PRECEDENT DATA

## 1.1 Objective

Research judgments or verdicts from the Supreme Court of India for legal precedents and collect the data into a spreadsheet. You will be given a specific year and a volume from this website: https://digiscr.sci.gov.in/. Please do not work on a different year or a different volume, as other researchers would be working on those and your work if duplicate is not useful.

## 1.2 Task

Browse through each judgment/order, and identify legal precedents. Remember, we are not looking for data regarding the judgment/order, but only for the precedents in references. 

## 1.3 Deliverable

Look for the following data elements, for each precedent, and format it as the columns of a spreadsheet. Deliver the spreadsheet as an XLSX file or a CSV file.
