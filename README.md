# 1 PRECEDENT DATA

## 1.1 Objective

Research judgments or verdicts from the Supreme Court of India for legal precedents and collect the data into a spreadsheet. You will be given a specific year and a volume from this website: https://digiscr.sci.gov.in/. Please do not work on a different year or a different volume, as other researchers would be working on those and your work if duplicate is not useful.

## 1.2 Task

Browse through each judgment/order, and identify legal precedents. Remember, we are not looking for data regarding the judgment/order, but only for the precedents in references. 

## 1.3 Deliverable

Look for the following data elements, for each precedent, and format it as the columns of a spreadsheet. Deliver the spreadsheet as an XLSX file or a CSV file.

## Accuracy

The data you collect must be ninety seven percent (97%) accurate. If you deliver data with 31 columns, only 2 columns can be inaccurate. More than this, your deliverable will be rejected (without payment). 

You must check the data manually. Please note that you can use AI tools to collect data, but most of them are notorious for delivering false data. So, be sure to double-check the data that AI tools give you. Using AI tools will CANNOT be an excuse for providing inaccurate data.

## Completeness

Your data must be at least 85% complete. If you deliver a row of 31 columns, you must have at least 26 correct values collected. If there are less than 26 values, your data will be rejected (without payment). 

Please download the [data sample](https://m.c) for examples of how to collect data. But please remember that the data sample has errors. That does not mean that your deliverable can have errors.
